QUESTION 1
Create a basic deployment pipeline that deploys your application to different environments, such as development, staging, and production. Implement testing and approval steps for each environment.


pipeline {
	    agent any
	    stages {
	        stage('Build') {
	            steps {
	                // Steps to build the code
	                echo "Performing build"
	            }
	        }
	        stage('Package') {
	            steps {
	                // Steps to Save the artifcat
	                echo "Performing Artifact package"
	            }
	        }
	      
	        stage('Deployment') {

	            steps {

	      		// Create an Approval Button with a timeout of 15minutes.
	                timeout(time: 15, unit: "MINUTES") {
	                    input message: 'Do you want to approve the deployment?', ok: 'Yes'
	                }
			
	                echo "Initiating deployment"

	            }

	        }

	    }

	}
